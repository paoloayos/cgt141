	   <p>The processor is the brain of the computer. The more powerful processor you have the faster it can complete its tasks. I7 or Ryzen 7 is recommended. When comparing 2 processors from the same brand (Intel/AMD)&nbsp; higher number next to it is better.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

	  <p>The graphics card processes what shows up on your screen. Most processors have them built in but for CGT, having a dedicated one is very useful. When Comparing 2 graphics cards from the same brand (Nvidia/AMD) higher number next to it is better</p>

     <h2>RAM</h2>
		
     <img src="https://www.nerdsshop.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/laptop-ram.jpeg" alt="" style="width:75%;">
     <p>RAM is basically your computers short term memory, having more allows you to have more programs and chrome tabs open. 8Gb+ is recommended but depends</p> 
   </div>

<div class="thumbnail_big"> 
	<h2>Storage</h2>

	<p>This is what all your files are stored on, you want to make sure you have space for everything you need. 512Gb+ is recommended</p>

	  <h1> Other important considerations</h1>
		<h2>Resolution</h2>
		
	    <p>Resolution changes how high quality the screen is. 1080p the most common and is perfectly fine in most situations, but if you are doing graphic design work, you may want to upgrade to 4k</p>
	    
<h2>Refresh rate</h2>
		
		<p> This is how many images you screen displays per second. 60hz = 60 images per second. you can upgrade to 144hz, 240hz, or even 300hz which will make your computer feel significanylu more responsive and better to use but in general is completely optional.</p>
	  <h2>High dynamic range</h2>
		
		<p> Allows your screen to display a wider range of colors with deeper darks and brighter whites. Recommended if you are doing graphics design work&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>100% Adobe RGB</h2>
		
		<p> This is a color gamut certification that make sure your computer can disply all the colors in the sRGB color space so you get very accurate colors and great image quality. Generally doesnt matter but recomended if you are doing things that involve color.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>IPS:</h2>
		
		<p> Completely gets rid of the color distortion if you look at your screen off-angle. You always want this&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2>Touch screen/Pen touch</h2>
		<p> Allows the you to use their fingers or a stylus on the screen to move the cursor around instead of a mouse. recomended if you are doing graphic design or anything artsy</p>
		<h2>Ports</h2>
		<p> You want to make sure you have all the ports you need so you can do everything you need to. For examples of ports you would want are:</p>
	
		<ul>
  <li>USB type A</li>
  <li>USB type C</li>
  <li>Audio Jack</li>
  <li>HDMI port</li>
  <li>SD Card Reader</li>
  <li>Ethernet</li>
      </ul>  

		<h2>Biometrics</h2>
	  <p> Login in to your laptop without a password</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Windows Hello</li>
		  <li>Finger print sensor</li>
		  <li>Face ID</li>
      </ul>
